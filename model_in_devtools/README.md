# MyMiniMusicMosaicModel

Quoting from the course material...

> The Model keeps the state of the application (Application State). 
> It is an abstract object, i.e. it knows nothing about graphics and interaction.

...and this is exactly what this model does, with some extra convenience functions.
To test, just get in the very directory of this `README.md`, then

```
$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server -p 8088
```

hence point your browser at http://localhost:8088.
